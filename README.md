# Falcon 9 Landing Prediction
 A project to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage landing will be successful.
 The Jupyter Notebooks represent different steps of this project. You can find below these different steps.


# 1. Data collection API
Collected some data from SpaceX API and performed some data formatting.

# 2. Data collection with webscraping
Collected some data from a Wikipedia page and performed some data formatting/cleaning.

# 3. Data wrangling
Perfomed some EDA, mainly converting the data in the 'Outcome' column into Training Labels.

# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL
Some EDA using SQL queries to answer some questions about the SpaceX Mission data. 

# 5. Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas & Matplotlib
Further EDA with visuals, using Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.

# 6. Interactive Visual Analytics & Dashboard
Interactive analysis of launch records with Plotly Dash. Interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.

# 7. Machine Learning Predictive Analysis (Classification)
Train-test split to find the best parameters for SVM, Classification Trees, KNN, and Logistic Regression. We determine the method that performs best using test data (here based on accuracy).
